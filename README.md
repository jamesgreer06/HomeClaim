A Resource made almost entirely with ChatGPT (lmao) because I don't know lua but I want this function on my private BeamMP server.

Current problem at hand is I cannot figure out how to pass events between server -> client correctly. Commands and saving is working but loading vehicles back in after rejoin is not. 
Also, yes I will be switching this from json for database this is just while im developing the resource, this is also a resource meant for a private server.
